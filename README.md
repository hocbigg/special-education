# Summary

The Special Education curriculum is a **complete education in Special Education** using online materials.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.

## Intro

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Foundations of Special Education / Disability Inclusion & History** | To understand what “special education” means: its history, underlying philosophy, societal roles, and basic concepts of inclusion. | *Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice* — a foundational book for inclusive education design and understanding learner variability. ([CAST Professional Publishing](https://publishing.cast.org/catalog/books-products/universal-design-for-learning-meyer-rose-gordon?srsltid=AfmBOoqztCwM6ej2dP31DPLgVjazatHJ6xqqa92gWsMIScRfDWAAnDsX&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | [Disability Inclusion in Education: Building Systems of Support](https://www.coursera.org/learn/disability-inclusion-education?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Introduction to Human Development** | So you know typical developmental trajectories — physical, cognitive, social, emotional — as a baseline for recognizing atypical patterns. | *Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective* (open-textbook) — comprehensive across life stages. ([Open Education Network](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/540?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | [Development Across the Lifespan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/development-across-the-lifespan?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Learning Theory & Educational Psychology (Basics)** | Gives mental models of how people learn, remember, and behave — essential for designing instruction or interventions. | *Educational Psychology* by Anita Woolfolk — a classic, comprehensive, widely used foundational text. ([Educational Psychology - Anita Woolfolk Hoy](https://books.google.com/books/about/Educational_Psychology.html?id=2elEAAAAYAAJ&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) <br>Alternative free version: *Educational Psychology* by K. Seifert (global textbook project). ([Educational Psychology](https://www.opentextbooks.org.hk/system/files/export/6/6118/pdf/Educational_Psychology_6118.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | [Learning, Knowledge, and Human Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-knowledge-human-development?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Professional Ethics in Education (Intro to Disability Rights & Inclusion)** | To build awareness of moral, social, and legal responsibilities when working with vulnerable or disabled populations — a baseline for all further practice. | *Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice* (see above) — includes discussion of equitable design and respect for learner variability. ([CAST Professional Publishing](https://publishing.cast.org/catalog/books-products/universal-design-for-learning-meyer-rose-gordon?srsltid=AfmBOoqztCwM6ej2dP31DPLgVjazatHJ6xqqa92gWsMIScRfDWAAnDsX&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | (No single MOOC found that covers broad educational ethics + disability rights well as of now — this cell may remain blank. You might draw on open lectures or book chapters as you proceed.) |


## Core

### Psychological & Developmental

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Developmental Psychology (Full lifespan scope)** | Deepens understanding of human growth and transitions over time — vital for recognizing developmental delays or differences. | *Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective* (open-textbook) — see above. ([Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/540?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | [Development Across the Lifespan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/development-across-the-lifespan?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Cognitive Psychology** | To understand how perception, memory, attention, and executive functioning work — many disabilities affect these processes. | *Atkinson & Hilgard’s Introduction to Psychology* — classic for foundational cognitive psychology topics. ([Atkinson & Hilgard’s Introduction to Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_%26_Hilgard%27s_Introduction_to_Psychology?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | (No universally accepted free full-course video matched — but many university intro-psych playlists on YouTube can fill in; could also self-assemble using open lectures.) |
| **Behavioral Psychology & Learning** | Many special education interventions draw on behavioral principles (reinforcement, behavior modification); understanding behavior scientifically is key. | *Educational Psychology* (Woolfolk) — includes coverage of behaviorism, reinforcement, classroom behavior management. ([Educational Psychology - Anita Woolfolk Hoy](https://books.google.com/books/about/Educational_Psychology.html?id=2elEAAAAYAAJ&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Use the Coursera course above (“Learning, Knowledge, and Human Development”) as a starting point; supplement with open YouTube lectures on behavioral learning theory. ([Learning, Knowledge, and Human Development | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-knowledge-human-development?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| **Introduction to Neuroscience for Educators** | Connects brain development and structure to learning — essential when dealing with neurodevelopmental disabilities. | (No single “educational neuroscience” classic book listed here — could draw from developmental psychology or neuroscience textbooks, depending on background.) | (Likewise, use open university lectures or free video series on developmental neurobiology / brain & learning; optional depending on your depth goals.) |


### Disability Studies & Educational Systems

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Introduction to Disability Studies** | To shift perspective from “fixing deficits” to understanding disability in social, cultural, rights-based frameworks. | *Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice* — provides a framework for understanding diversity and inclusive design. ([CAST Professional Publishing](https://publishing.cast.org/catalog/books-products/universal-design-for-learning-meyer-rose-gordon?srsltid=AfmBOoqztCwM6ej2dP31DPLgVjazatHJ6xqqa92gWsMIScRfDWAAnDsX&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | [Disability Inclusion in Education: Building Systems of Support](https://www.coursera.org/learn/disability-inclusion-education?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Exceptionality Categories in Education (Overview of disability types)** | To become familiar with different categories (learning disabilities, autism, sensory, physical, etc.), their characteristics and support needs. | (There tends to be no one “encyclopedia of exceptionality” textbook — this will likely require combining chapters from several sources or course notes.) | (No general MOOC covers all exceptionality types comprehensively — you may need to take specialized courses later, or use individual lecture series on particular disability types.) |
| **Special Education Law, Policy & Advocacy** | Understanding legal and policy frameworks ensures ethical, rights-based service and advocacy for learners with disabilities. | (Formal textbooks may vary by country; you may need region-specific resources.) | [Disability Inclusion in Education: Building Systems of Support](https://www.coursera.org/learn/disability-inclusion-education?utm_source=chatgpt.com) includes some policy and systemic support content. |
| **Cultural & Linguistic Diversity in Special Education** | To appreciate intersectionality — disability intersects with culture, language, socioeconomics; this affects identification, assessment, and inclusion. | (Often addressed in chapters across texts on inclusive education; no single canonical book emerges here.) | (Use open lectures or case-study series; you might pair general inclusion MOOCs with region-specific readings.) |


### Instructional Design & Assessment

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Assessment in Special Education (Foundations)** | To learn how to use, interpret, and apply assessment data fairly — screening, diagnostic tools, progress monitoring. | (Often found as chapters in special education or assessment textbooks; no single open textbook widely recognized.) | (Supplement with open lectures on educational assessment / psychometrics — maybe part of educational psychology or special ed courses.) |
| **Evidence-Based Instructional Strategies** | So teaching/intervention is not guesswork — but guided by methods supported by research. | *Educational Psychology* (Woolfolk) — offers evidence-based teaching, motivation, learning strategies. ([Educational Psychology - Anita Woolfolk Hoy](https://books.google.com/books/about/Educational_Psychology.html?id=2elEAAAAYAAJ&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | [Learning, Knowledge, and Human Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-knowledge-human-development?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (Coursera) as foundational; supplement with accessible YouTube lectures on structured literacy, differentiated instruction, etc. |
| **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** | Core inclusive framework: design curriculum to fit diversity rather than retrofitting later. | *Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice* — canonical UDL textbook. ([CAST Professional Publishing](https://publishing.cast.org/catalog/books-products/universal-design-for-learning-meyer-rose-gordon?srsltid=AfmBOoqztCwM6ej2dP31DPLgVjazatHJ6xqqa92gWsMIScRfDWAAnDsX&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) <br>Also: an open-access guide: *A Comprehensive Guide to Applying Universal Design for Learning* (PDF). ([A Comprehensive Guide to Applying Universal Design for Learning (PDF)](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/jibcudl/open/download?type=pdf&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | (No large MOOC widely recognized — but UDL modules appear within inclusion / special education courses like the Coursera one above.) |
| **Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS) / Behavior Management Foundations** | To build supportive learning environments and address behavioral challenges ethically and effectively. | (Often taught in specialized special-education or behavior-support texts; you might combine chapters from multiple sources.) | (Search for open lectures / YouTube series on PBIS, behavior management, applied behavior analysis basics.) |


### Applied Practice & Systems Integration

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Curriculum Adaptation & Differentiation** | To flexibly adapt curriculum content/process/assessment for diverse learners — key for inclusive classrooms and individualized instruction. | *Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice* — includes foundational principles for adaptation and differentiation. ([CAST Professional Publishing](https://publishing.cast.org/catalog/books-products/universal-design-for-learning-meyer-rose-gordon?srsltid=AfmBOoqztCwM6ej2dP31DPLgVjazatHJ6xqqa92gWsMIScRfDWAAnDsX&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Use inclusion/UDL-related lectures and resources; perhaps part of inclusion MOOCs like the [Disability Inclusion in Education](https://www.coursera.org/learn/disability-inclusion-education?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Coursera course. |
| **Assistive Technology & Accessible Design** | To understand how tools (low-tech or tech) can remove barriers and support inclusion for sensory, physical, or cognitive differences. | (No single open textbook identified — might draw from assistive technology literature, HCI / design books, or practice guides.) | (You may rely on case study videos, school-based practice videos, or webinars; resources vary heavily by context.) |
| **Collaboration with Families & Multidisciplinary Teams** | Because special education rarely happens in isolation — you’ll need to coordinate with families, therapists, other professionals. | (Often covered in chapters of broader special ed texts, inclusive education guides or professional manuals.) | (Workshops, webinars, and video case-studies may be useful; look for “family collaboration in special ed” or “IEP team” lectures.) |
| **Classroom Management for Inclusive Settings** | Real classrooms are messy and dynamic — good management supports inclusion, respect, and effective instruction. | *Educational Psychology* (Woolfolk) — includes chapters on classroom management, motivation, and diversity. ([Educational Psychology - Anita Woolfolk Hoy](https://books.google.com/books/about/Educational_Psychology.html?id=2elEAAAAYAAJ&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Combine educational psychology course materials with teacher-training videos on inclusive classroom management (many available on YouTube or university teaching-prep platforms). |


## Advanced

Because specialization is broad, many resources will be niche; below are suggestions for general-purpose coverage; for deeper specialization you may need domain-specific courses/texts.

### Learning Disabilities & Academic Interventions

| Subject | Why study? | Book / Resource | Videos / MOOC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Advanced Literacy Interventions / Structured Literacy & Dyslexia Support | To support learners with reading/writing difficulties using evidence-based strategies. | *Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice* — UDL principles support differentiated reading/writing instruction. ([CAST Professional Publishing](https://publishing.cast.org/catalog/books-products/universal-design-for-learning-meyer-rose-gordon?srsltid=AfmBOoqztCwM6ej2dP31DPLgVjazatHJ6xqqa92gWsMIScRfDWAAnDsX&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Explore YouTube or university lecture playlists on structured literacy / dyslexia interventions (these tend to be specialized; no major MOOC stands out). |
| Math Learning Disabilities & Numeracy Interventions | To address difficulties in numeracy — common but often under-supported in special ed. | (No standard canonical textbook easily identified; would require collecting research reviews and specialist materials.) | As above — use specialized lectures, often from special ed or math-ed channels. |
| Intensive Progress Monitoring & Data-Informed Instruction | To measure learning over time and adjust instruction responsively — critical for individualized education planning. | (Often covered in assessment & special ed textbooks or professional manuals.) | You might find webinars or training videos on data-driven instruction, IEP progress tracking, etc. |

### Autism & Developmental Disorders

| Subject | Why study? | Book / Resource | Videos / MOOC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Autism-Specific Assessment & Supports | To understand unique needs and design appropriate supports for autistic learners. | (No single canonical generalist textbook; often specialized books or manuals.) | Look for university-hosted lecture series or free webcasts on autism spectrum disorders in educational contexts. |
| Social-Communication Interventions | To help build communication, social understanding, peer relationships for learners with social difficulties. | (Likely covered in autism intervention literature — no universal free textbook identified.) | As above — specialized videos, webinars, therapy demonstration videos. |
| Structured Teaching & Environmental Design (e.g., TEACCH, routine-based supports) | To create predictable, supportive environments that reduce anxiety and maximize learning for neurodiverse learners. | (Often in specialized applied books or manuals.) | Some YouTube lectures or recorded workshops might be available under “structured teaching in autism education.” |

### Behavior Support & Applied Behavior Analysis (Ethical)

| Subject | Why study? | Book / Resource | Videos / MOOC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) | To understand why behaviors occur and design appropriate interventions rather than punitive measures. | (Materials typically in behavior-analysis texts or special education resources.) | Online webinars or ABA-training video series (many free or low-cost) may serve here. |
| Behavior Intervention Planning (ethical, evidence-based) | So interventions respect dignity and rights, and are effective. | (As above — specialized texts/manuals.) | Video demonstrations / case studies (e.g., classroom behavior support) — accessible via educator networks or YouTube. |
| Ethical Practice in Behavior Support | To ensure interventions respect autonomy, consent, and avoid harmful practices. | (Included in many special ed or ABA-ethics texts; may also be found in professional guidelines.) | Lectures/webinars on ethics in special education, inclusive practice, human rights in disability support. |

### Sensory, Physical, & Multiple Disabilities

Similar to above: resources tend to be specialized (assistive-tech manuals, therapy guides, rehabilitative education texts). For many of these, you will need to locate regionally relevant material or NGO-provided guides, as universal MOOCs are scarce.

### Inclusive Education & Systems Design

| Subject | Why study? | Book / Resource | Videos / MOOC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inclusive Schoolwide Practices / Program Design | To build inclusive classrooms or schools that integrate learners with diverse needs. | *Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice* — offers foundational framework for inclusiveness and flexible curriculum design. ([CAST Professional Publishing](https://publishing.cast.org/catalog/books-products/universal-design-for-learning-meyer-rose-gordon?srsltid=AfmBOoqztCwM6ej2dP31DPLgVjazatHJ6xqqa92gWsMIScRfDWAAnDsX&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | [Disability Inclusion in Education](https://www.coursera.org/learn/disability-inclusion-education?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (Coursera) includes content about systemic inclusion strategies. |
| Education Policy & Equity Analysis (inclusion, rights, equity) | To understand structural barriers and how to advocate for equitable education at systemic level. | (Often requires combining policy studies, disability studies, social justice in education literature.) | Use open lectures in inclusive education policy, human rights in education, etc.; may need localized resources depending on region. |
| Program Design & Evaluation for Inclusive Education | To plan, implement, and evaluate inclusive programs reliably. | (Often in professional manuals or specialized books; no universal open textbook I found.) | Webinars or course modules on program evaluation, inclusive program management, perhaps via NGO or university continuing-education resources. |

## Capstone

Because the capstone project can take many forms (individual intervention plan, inclusion program proposal, assistive-tech implementation, research-based review, etc.), there is no single “course.” Instead:

- Use **books and resources** from across the phases (particularly from UDL, inclusive education, assessment, intervention design).
- Use **MOOCs or lecture series** already listed (especially those on inclusion, developmental psychology, educational psychology) as theoretical scaffolding.
- Optionally, consult **specialized resources** depending on your project: e.g., assistive-technology guides; behavior intervention manuals; disability-specific support manuals; inclusive-education policy documents; research articles.

## Observations & Gaps

- Some advanced/specialization topics — especially disability-specific interventions, assistive technology, behavior support, sensory/physical disabilities — do **not** map cleanly to free, high-quality, comprehensive MOOCs or open textbooks. Expect to rely on **specialized professional manuals, research articles, regional materials, or pay-walled texts** for depth.
- Ethical, legal, cultural, and familial collaboration aspects often depend heavily on context (country, language, policy environment). For these, you might need **local legal texts, policy documents, or culturally-relevant studies**.
- For many behavior-management or therapy-oriented tracks, video/demonstration content may live scattered across YouTube, NGO websites, professional training portals — there is **no universal standard course**.

## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Special Education.
Congratulations!
