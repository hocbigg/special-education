# Great Courses

This is a list of high-quality courses that, for one reason or another, didn't make it into the curriculum.
The most common reasons are that the course isn't available often enough,
or that there was an alternative that fit better into the curriculum.

*Why these are “extras”:* some are introductory or overlapping with core topics; others are more practice-oriented or have variable academic depth — good for broadening perspective, for initial exposure, or for continuing professional development.
