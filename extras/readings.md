# Great Readings

This document consists of great books or articles on [Field].
Some are here because there is a course covering the same material;
some are just great books that you should read at some point in your career.

Once you have made it through most of the curriculum, knowing whether a book is worth your time will become easier.
Or, if you are struggling in one of the courses, perhaps reading a book on the subject will help.

*Why they matter:* These books go beyond basic pedagogy or assessment: they explore inclusive philosophy, international policy/practice comparisons, intersectionality (how disability intersects race, class, culture), and evidence-based inclusive practices. They’re ideal for deepening theoretical grounding or framing inclusive education in broader social contexts.
