# Changing the curriculum

This curriculum thrives because of the changes made by our many contributors. Read on for details on how to help every student that follows you.

## Non-substantive changes

If you have non-substantive updates to make to the curriculum, such as a course's URL having been moved, spelling/syntax errors, etc., please send a [pull request](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) to fix any mistakes that you have found.

## Substantive changes

If you have specific and substantive criticisms of the curriculum, i.e. problems related to the progression/content of courses it would be appropriate to [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). While it is acceptable to point out problems, all successful changes naturally require a plan for fixing the problem.

## Other ways to contribute

### Responding to Issues
Issues require more than just users to suggest them. Issues require active community members to read and respond to proposals. Even adding simple [emoji reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can help the community.
